- 👋 Hi, I’m Nur!
- 🧠 I believe in the power of human brain and I'm very enthusiastic about learning new things.
- 👩🏻‍🏫 I was teaching language and I found myself learning IT languages - which I loved.
- 📚 I'm a student now and I will always be, because learning never ends -- the only constant is change...
